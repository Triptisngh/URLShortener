# URLShortener
This is a Java program that creates a graphical user interface for a URL shortener. The program uses the Gson library to serialize and deserialize JSON objects, and it saves and loads the URLs to/from a file. The GUI has a text field where the user enters a URL to shorten, a button to generate a short URL and save it to a JSON object.
